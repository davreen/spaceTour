        <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
        <p>NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is the United States government agency responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research. Established on July 29, 1958, NASA has since become one of the most well-known and influential space agencies in the world.</p>
        <p>Mission and Objectives:
          NASA's primary mission is to explore space, conduct scientific research, and advance the understanding of Earth and the universe. Its objectives include:<br>     
      <br>
            distant planets, moons, and celestial bodies.<br> 
            Earth's climate, weather, and natural disasters.<br> 
           advanced space technologies. <br>
         Conducting research in aeronautics and improving aviation safety.<br>
           Collaborating with international space agencies on joint missions.<br>
          
          </p>
          <p>Space Exploration:
            NASA is responsible for launching missions to explore the solar system and beyond. Some of its most notable achievements include the Apollo Moon missions, the Mars rovers, and the Voyager probes that have traveled beyond our solar system. NASA also operates the International Space Station (ISS) in collaboration with other countries.<br>
            
            <p>Scientific Research:
              NASA conducts a wide range of scientific research to better understand our planet and the cosmos. This includes Earth science missions to monitor climate change, space telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope, and robotic missions to study other planets, asteroids, and comets.<br></p>
            
           <p> Space Technology:
            NASA develops cutting-edge technologies for space exploration, which often find applications beyond space missions. Examples include advancements in materials science, propulsion systems, and satellite technology.<br> </p> 
            
           <p>  Aeronautics Research:
            In addition to space exploration, NASA plays a key role in advancing aviation technology and safety. It conducts research to develop more efficient aircraft, reduce emissions, and improve air traffic management.<br> </p> 
            
            <p>
              International Collaboration:
            NASA frequently collaborates with other space agencies, such as the European Space Agency (ESA), the Russian space agency Roscosmos, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), on various space missions. This cooperation promotes scientific discovery and the sharing of resources and expertise.<br>
          
            </p>
            
           <p>  Education and Outreach:
            NASA is committed to inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers. It engages in extensive educational and outreach programs, including educational materials, contests, and public events, to promote STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education.<br>   </p> 
            
           <p>  Human Spaceflight:
            While NASA's human spaceflight program has evolved over the years, it remains a significant part of the agency's mission. NASA has sent astronauts to the Moon, conducted numerous space shuttle missions, and continues to send astronauts to the International Space Station.<br> </p> 
            
            <p> Future Goals:
              NASA has ambitious plans for the future, including sending astronauts to Mars, exploring asteroids and the outer planets, and conducting more extensive Earth science research. These missions are part of NASA's broader vision for the exploration and understanding of the universe. </p>

        <h2>Travel around planets</h2>
        <p>Space tourism refers to the commercial activity of sending private individuals (tourists) into space for recreational, leisure, or adventure purposes. It involves providing paying customers with the opportunity to experience space travel, even if it's for a short duration, and to witness the unique sights and sensations that come with leaving Earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Space tourism offers people the chance to go beyond the confines of our planet and experience the thrill of weightlessness, see the curvature of the Earth, and witness the vastness of space. This industry has gained significant attention in recent years as private companies have developed spacecraft and launch systems to cater to the growing interest in space travel.</p>

          <h1>Suborbital Space Tourism </h1>
         
          <p> Suborbital flights take passengers briefly above the Kármán line, the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space (about 100 kilometers or 62 miles above Earth). These flights provide a few minutes of weightlessness and panoramic views of Earth but do not complete a full orbit around the planet. Companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are working on suborbital space tourism.
